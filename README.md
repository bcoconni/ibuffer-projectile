# ibuffer-projectile: Group buffers in ibuffer list by projectile project #

Emacs' `ibuffer-mode` is a wonderful replacement for the built-in
`list-buffer` command, and allows buffers to be grouped
programatically, e.g. by major mode.

You might like to see your buffers grouped by the associated version
control project.

That's where `ibuffer-projectile` comes in: it lets you group your
buffers by their projectile root directory

## How to install ##

See `ibuffer-projectile.el`, or (preferred) install from [Melpa][Melpa].
