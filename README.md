# ibuffer-projectile: Group buffers in ibuffer list by projectile project #

Emacs' `ibuffer-mode` is a wonderful replacement for the built-in
`list-buffer` command, and allows buffers to be grouped
programatically, e.g. by major mode.

`ibuffer-projectile` lets you group your buffers by their projectile
root directory.

I personally use [ibuffer-vc](https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-vc)
because I prefer its grouping behaviour, but I thought this would be
useful to some people too.

## How to install ##

See `ibuffer-projectile.el`, or (preferred) install from [Melpa][Melpa].
